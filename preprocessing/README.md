# Preprocessing

## Structure

* `Preprocessing.ipynb`: The notebook used to preprocess the data.
* `final.csv`: The final processed data used.
* `performances.csv`: One row for each skater/team, for each program.
* `judged-aspects.csv`: One row for each "executed element" and "program component", foreach performance at each competition.
* `judge-scores.csv`: One row for each judge, for each judged aspect, for each performanceat each competition.
* `judges.csv`: The ISU posts the names of each judge (for each program) on a series ofHTML pages on its website. BuzzFeed.News collected all of the judge names from those pagesand standardized that data. On the ISU's website, judges are often labeled simply asmembers of the ISU instead of their home country. 
* `judge-country.csv` is the final csv processed by BuzzFeed News to identify each judge'shome country [(here)](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-02-figure-skating-analysis/blobmaster/data/processed/judge-country.csv).
