# Data Visualization project

At the end of each competition it oversees, the [International Skating Union](http://www.isu.org/) releases a PDF containing all scores given for each performance. That report is known as a "Protocol," and an example can be [found here](http://www.isuresults.com/results/season1718/gpf1718/gpf2017_protocol.pdf). The code in this repository downloads a series of protocol PDFs, and then extracts structured data from the scoring sheets they contain.

Currently, the data in this repository includes every major international competition from October 2016 through December 2017. You can find a list of those 17 competitions below.

## Data

### CSV Structure

The CSV-formatted data is split up into four files:

- `performances.csv`: One row for each skater/team, for each program.

- `judged-aspects.csv`: One row for each "executed element" and "program component", for each performance at each competition.

- `judge-scores.csv`: One row for each judge, for each judged aspect, for each performance at each competition.

- `judges.csv`: The ISU posts the names of each judge (for each program) on a series of HTML pages on its website. BuzzFeed News collected all of the judge names from those pages and standardized that data. On the ISU's website, judges are often labeled simply as members of the ISU instead of their home country. BuzzFeed News used the ISU's lists of officials for the 2017-18 season and the 2016-17 season to identify each judge's home country. You can find the results in [`judge-country.csv`](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-02-figure-skating-analysis/blob/master/data/processed/judge-country.csv).

### Data Dictionary

- `performances.csv`:
    - __performance_id__: An ID unique to each performance in a program of a competition. Autogenerated for the CSV files.
    - __competition__: The name of the competition, e.g., "ISU European Figure Skating Championships 2017".

    - __rank__: Final place in the program.
    - __starting_number__: The order in which the skaters skated.
    - __total_segment_score__: The total score for the program.
    - __total_element_score__: The total score of all elements in the program.
    - __total_component_score__: The total score of all components in the program. 
	- __total_deductions__: The total deductions given by the technical panel for the performance.

- `judged-aspects.csv`:
    - __aspect_id__: A ID unique to each element or component during a skater's performance. Autogenerated for the CSV files.

    - __section__: The type of aspect; either `element` or `component`.
    - __aspect_num__: The positional order of the aspect within the performance and section.
    - __aspect_desc__: Shorthand notation for the aspect. For instance, a double lutz would be marked `2Lz`.
    - __info_flag__: A marking by the technical panel, such "<" for an under-rotated jump.
    - __credit_flag__: An "X" in this column means that the skater received "credit for highlight distribution" for that element, which increases the base value.
	- __base_value__: The base number of points for the performed element.
	- __factor__: The amount by which the component score is multipled to calculate its final value.
	- __goe__: The overall translated Grade of Execution (GOE) given by the judging panel.
	- __scores_of_panel__: The judging panel's total score for the aspect.

- `judge-scores.csv`:
    - __aspect_id__: See above.
    - __judge__: The identifier assigned to the judge, e.g., "J1".
	- __score__: The GOE (for elements) or score (for components) awarded by the judge for the aspect.
